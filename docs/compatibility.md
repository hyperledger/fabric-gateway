Each minor release version of Fabric Gateway client API targets the current supported versions of Go, and the current long-term support (LTS) releases of Node and Java. A specific minimum version of Hyperledger Fabric for the Gateway peer is also required for full functionality.

The following table shows versions of Fabric, programming language runtimes, and other dependencies that are explicitly tested and that are supported for use with the latest version of the Fabric Gateway client API.
