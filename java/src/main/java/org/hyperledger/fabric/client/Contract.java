/**
 * Represents a smart contract instance in a network.
 * Applications should get a Contract instance from a Network using the
 * {@link Network#getContract(String) getContract} method.
 *
 * <p>The Contract allows applications to:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Evaluate transactions that query state from the ledger using {@link #evaluateTransaction(String, String...)}
 *     or {@link #evaluateTransaction(String, byte[][]) evaluateTransaction(String, byte[]...)}.</li>
 *     <li>Submit transactions that store state to the ledger using {@link #submitTransaction(String, String...)} or
 *     {@link #submitTransaction(String, byte[][]) submitTransaction(String, byte[]...)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For more complex transaction invocations, such as including transient data, the transaction proposal can be built
 * using {@link #newProposal(String)}. Once built, the proposal can either be evaluated, or can be sent for endorsement
 * and the resulting transaction object can be submitted to the orderer to be committed to the ledger.
 *
 * <h2>Evaluate transaction flow</h2>
 * <pre><code>
 *     byte[] result = contract.newProposal("transactionName")
 *             .addArguments("one", "two")
 *             // Specify additional proposal options, such as transient data
 *             .build()
 *             .evaluate();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h2>Submit transaction flow</h2>
 * <pre><code>
 *     byte[] result = contract.newProposal("transactionName")
 *             .addArguments("one", "two")
 *             // Specify additional proposal options, such as transient data
 *             .build()
 *             .endorse()
 *             .submitSync();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h2>Off-line signing</h2>
 *
 * <p>By default, proposal and transaction messages will be signed using the signing implementation specified when
 * connecting the Gateway. In cases where an external client holds the signing credentials, a signing implementation
 * can be omitted when connecting the Gateway and off-line signing can be carried out by:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Returning the serialized proposal or transaction message along with its digest to the client for them to
 *     generate a signature.</li>
 *     <li>On receipt of the serialized message and signature from the client, creating a signed proposal or transaction
 *     using the Contract's {@link #newSignedProposal(byte[], byte[])} or {@link #newSignedTransaction(byte[], byte[])}
 *     methods respectively.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Off-line signing of proposal</h3>
 * <pre><code>
 *     Proposal unsignedProposal = contract.newProposal("transactionName").build();
 *     byte[] proposalBytes = unsignedProposal.getBytes();
 *     byte[] proposalDigest = unsignedProposal.getDigest();
 *     // Generate signature from digest
 *     Proposal signedProposal = contract.newSignedProposal(proposalBytes, proposalSignature);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Off-line signing of transaction</h3>
 * <pre><code>
 *     Transaction unsignedTransaction = signedProposal.endorse();
 *     byte[] transactionBytes = unsignedTransaction.getBytes();
 *     byte[] transactionDigest = unsignedTransaction.getDigest();
 *     // Generate signature from digest
 *     Transaction signedTransaction = contract.newSignedTransaction(transactionBytes, transactionSignature);
 * </code></pre>
