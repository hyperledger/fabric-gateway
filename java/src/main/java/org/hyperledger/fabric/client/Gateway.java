/**
 * The Gateway provides the connection point for an application to access the Fabric network as a specific user. It is
 * instantiated from a Builder instance that is created using {@link #newInstance()} and configured using a gateway URL
 * and a signing identity. It can then be connected to a fabric network using the
 * {@link Builder#connect()} method. Once connected, it can then access individual {@link Network} instances (channels)
 * using the {@link #getNetwork(String) getNetwork} method which in turn can access the {@link Contract} installed on a
 * network and {@link Contract#submitTransaction(String, String...) submit transactions} to the ledger.
 *
 * <p>Gateway instances should be reused for multiple transaction invocations and only closed once connection to the
 * Fabric network is no longer required.</p>
 *
 * <p>Multiple Gateway instances may share the same underlying gRPC connection by supplying the gRPC {@code Channel} as
 * an option to the Gateway connect.</p>
 *
