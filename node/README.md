# Hyperledger Fabric Gateway Client SDK for Node


The Fabric Gateway SDK allows applications to interact with a Fabric blockchain network.  It provides a simple API to submit transactions to a ledger or query the contents of a ledger with minimal code.

The Gateway SDK implements the Fabric programming model as described in the [Developing Applications](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/developing_applications.html) chapter of the Fabric documentation.

## How to use

Samples showing how to create a client application that updates and queries the ledger
are available for each of the supported SDK languages here:
