# Contributing to Hyperledger Fabric Gateway

We welcome contributions to the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io) Project. There's always plenty to do!

If you have any questions about the project or how to contribute, you can find on the [Hyperledger Rocket.Chat channels](https://chat.hyperledger.org/home).

Here are a few guidelines to help you contribute successfully...

## Issues

We currently track bug reports using the [Fabric Gateway project in Hyperledger's JIRA tool](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/FABGW/summary).

If you find a bug which we don't already know about, you can help us by creating a new issue describing the problem. Please include as much detail as possible to help us track down the cause.

> **Note:** Please use Rocket.Chat instead of JIRA to ask questions.

## Fixes

If you want to begin contributing code, looking through our open issues is a good way to start. Try looking for recent issues with detailed descriptions first, or ask us on Rocket.Chat if you're unsure which issue to choose.

## Enhancements

Make sure you have the support of the Hyperledger Fabric community before investing a lot of effort in project enhancements. For example, discuss your proposal on Rocket.Chat or open a JIRA issue for feedback before starting work. If it's a more substantial enhancement, you may be asked to follow [the formal request for comments (RFC) process](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/blob/main/README.md).
